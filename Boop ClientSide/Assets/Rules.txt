### Basics

---

Boop ! is a 2 players game.

Each player starts with 8 small pieces.

You can win by either:

- aligning 3 big pieces,
- or placing all 8 big pieces on the board.

3 pieces can be aligned either verticaly, horizontaly or diagonaly.

Aligning 3 pieces remove them from the board and either:

- upgrade the piece to big if it is small,
- or simply remove the piece from the board if it is already a big one.

### Turn

---

Players play one after the other.

During your turn you can either:

- left click to place a small piece on the board,
- or right click to place a big piece if you have some.

### Boop

---

When you place a piece on the board, every adjacent pieces are pushed away (or “Booped”).

There are 2 exceptions:

- a piece can’t be booped if another piece is already placed on the tile where it should be booped,
- a small piece can’t boop a big piece (but a big piece can boop another big piece)
